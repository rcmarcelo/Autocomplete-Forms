# Autocomplete Forms

Hey! This is my version of "Autocomplete To Improve Your Forms" Google Codelab. You can do your own version, just click [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/autocomplete).

The codelab teaches you how to use the [Autofill](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/06/checkout-faster-with-autofill) feature in order to help make things easier when filling forms.

I've improved my version with Material Design Lite. If you want to try it, just download and open the ```index.html```.
